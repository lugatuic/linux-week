# Linux Week
This is a collection of presentations used by the Linux Users Group at UIC as part of its recurring Linux Week (formerly Newbie Week) bootcamp.

## Building
To build the slides for your own use, simply:

- install `texlive` through your package manager of choice (recommend `-most` or `-full` for an easy experience)
- run `make`
